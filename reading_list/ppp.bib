Examples of country successes in strengthening of hitherto weak systems are emerging. The key to success has been to build collaborative partnerships involving local ownership by several sectors that span registration, justice, health, statistics, and civil society. Regional partners can be important to raise awareness, set regional goals and targets, foster country-to-country exchange and mutual learning, and build high-level political commitment. These regional partners continue to provide a platform through which country stakeholders, development partners, and technical experts can share experiences, develop and document good practices, and propose innovative approaches to tackle CRVS challenges.

abstract = {Increasing demand for better quality data and more investment to strengthen civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) systems will require increased emphasis on objective, comparable, cost-effective monitoring and assessment methods to measure progress. We apply a composite index (the vital statistics performance index [VSPI]) to assess the performance of CRVS systems in 148 countries or territories during 1980–2012 and classify them into five distinct performance categories, ranging from rudimentary (with scores close to zero) to satisfactory (with scores close to one), with a mean VSPI score since 2005 of 0{\textperiodcentered}61 (SD 0{\textperiodcentered}31). As expected, the best performing systems were mostly in the European region, the Americas, and Australasia, with only two countries from east Asia and Latin America. Most low-scoring countries were in the African or Asian regions. Globally, only modest progress has been made since 2000, with the percentage of deaths registered increasing from 36{\%} to 38{\%}, and the percentage of children aged under 5 years whose birth has been registered increasing from 58{\%} to 65{\%}. However, several individual countries have made substantial improvements to their CRVS systems in the past 30 years by capturing more deaths and improving accuracy of cause-of-death information. Future monitoring of the effects of CRVS strengthening will greatly benefit from application of a metric like the VSPI, which is objective, costless to compute, and able to identify components of the system that make the largest contributions to good or poor performance.},

However, for the great majority of developing countries without well-functioning vital registration systems, estimating the U5MR is challenging due to limited data availability and data quality issues. We describe a Bayesian penalized B-spline regression model for assessing levels and trends in the U5MR for all countries in the world, whereby biases in data series are estimated through the inclusion of a multilevel model to improve upon the limitations of current methods. B-spline smoothing parameters are also estimated through a multilevel model. Improved spline extrapolations are obtained through logarithmic pooling of the posterior predictive distribution of country-specific changes in spline coefficients with observed changes on the global level. The proposed model is able to flexibly capture changes in U5MR over time, gives point estimates and credible intervals reflecting potential biases in data series and performs reasonably well in out-of-sample validation exercises. It has been accepted by the United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation to generate estimates for all member countries.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND In the past two decades, the under-5 mortality rate in China has fallen substantially, but progress with regards to the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 4 at the subnational level has not been quantified. We aimed to estimate under-5 mortality rates in mainland China for the years 1970 to 2012. METHODS We estimated the under-5 mortality rate for 31 provinces in mainland China between 1970 and 2013 with data from censuses, surveys, surveillance sites, and disease surveillance points. We estimated under-5 mortality rates for 2851 counties in China from 1996 to 2012 with the reported child mortality numbers from the Annual Report System on Maternal and Child Health. We used a small area mortality estimation model, spatiotemporal smoothing, and Gaussian process regression to synthesise data and generate consistent provincial and county-level estimates. We compared progress at the county level with what was expected on the basis of income and educational attainment using an econometric model. We computed Gini coefficients to study the inequality of under-5 mortality rates across counties. FINDINGS In 2012, the lowest provincial level under-5 mortality rate in China was about five per 1000 livebirths, lower than in Canada, New Zealand, and the USA. The highest provincial level under-5 mortality rate in China was higher than that of Bangladesh. 29 provinces achieved a decrease in under-5 mortality rates twice as fast as the MDG 4 target rate; only two provinces will not achieve MDG 4 by 2015. Although some counties in China have under-5 mortality rates similar to those in the most developed nations in 2012, some have similar rates to those recorded in Burkina Faso and Cameroon. Despite wide differences, the inter-county Gini coefficient has been decreasing. Improvement in maternal education and the economic boom have contributed to the fall in child mortality; more than 60{\%} of the counties in China had rates of decline in under-5 mortality rates significantly faster than expected. Fast reduction in under-5 mortality rates have been recorded not only in the Han population, the dominant ethnic majority in China, but also in the minority populations. All top ten minority groups in terms of population sizes have experienced annual reductions in under-5 mortality rates faster than the MDG 4 target at 4.4{\%}. INTERPRETATION The reduction of under-5 mortality rates in China at the country, provincial, and county level is an extraordinary success story. Reductions of under-5 mortality rates faster than 8.8{\%} (twice MDG 4 pace) are possible. Extremely rapid declines seem to be related to public policy in addition to socioeconomic progress. Lessons from successful counties should prove valuable for China to intensify efforts for those with unacceptably high under-5 mortality rates.

abstract = {Structured additive regression models are perhaps the most commonly used class of models in statistical applications. It includes, among others, (generalized) linear models, (generalized) additive models, smoothing spline models, state space models, semiparametric regression, spatial and spatiotemporal models, log-Gaussian Cox processes and geostatistical and geoadditive models. We consider approximate Bayesian inference in a popular subset of structured additive regression models, latent Gaussian models, where the latent field is Gaussian, controlled by a few hyperparameters and with non-Gaussian response variables. The posterior marginals are not available in closed form owing to the non-Gaussian response variables. For such models, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods can be implemented, but they are not without problems, in terms of both convergence and computational time. In some practical applications, the extent of these problems is such that Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling is simply not an appropriate tool for routine analysis. We show that, by using an integrated nested Laplace approximation and its simplified version, we can directly compute very accurate approximations to the posterior marginals. The main benefit of these approximations is computational: where Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms need hours or days to run, our approximations provide more precise estimates in seconds or minutes. Another advantage with our approach is its generality, which makes it possible to perform Bayesian analysis in an automatic, streamlined way, and to compute model comparison criteria and various predictive measures so that models can be compared and the model under study can be challenged.},

abstract = {Background Despite the sharp decline in global under-5 deaths since 1990, uneven progress has been achieved across and within countries. In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for child mortality were met only by a few countries. Valid concerns exist as to whether the region would meet new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for under-5 mortality. We therefore examine further sources of variation by assessing age patterns, trends, and forecasts of mortality rates. Methods and findings Data came from 106 nationally representative Demographic and Health Surveys (DHSs) with full birth histories from 31 SSA countries from 1990 to 2017 (a total of 524 country-years of data). We assessed the distribution of age at death through the following new demographic analyses. First, we used a direct method and full birth histories to estimate under-5 mortality rates (U5MRs) on a monthly basis. Second, we smoothed raw estimates of death rates by age and time by using a two-dimensional P-Spline approach. Third, a variant of the Lee–Carter (LC) model, designed for populations with limited data, was used to fit and forecast age profiles of mortality. We used mortality estimates from the United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME) to adjust, validate, and minimize the risk of bias in survival, truncation, and recall in mortality estimation. Our mortality model revealed substantive declines of death rates at every age in most countries but with notable differences in the age patterns over time. U5MRs declined from 3.3{\%} (annual rate of reduction [ARR] 0.1{\%}) in Lesotho to 76.4{\%} (ARR 5.2{\%}) in Malawi, and the pace of decline was faster on average (ARR 3.2{\%}) than that observed for infant (IMRs) (ARR 2.7{\%}) and neonatal (NMRs) (ARR 2.0{\%}) mortality rates. We predict that 5 countries (Kenya, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, and Uganda) are on track to achieve the under-5 sustainable development target by 2030 (25 deaths per 1,000 live births), but only Rwanda and Tanzania would meet both the neonatal (12 deaths per 1,000 live births) and under-5 targets simultaneously. Our predicted NMRs and U5MRs were in line with those estimated by the UN IGME by 2030 and 2050 (they overlapped in 27/31 countries for NMRs and 22 for U5MRs) and by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) by 2030 (26/31 and 23/31, respectively). This study has a number of limitations, including poor data quality issues that reflected bias in the report of births and deaths, preventing reliable estimates and predictions from a few countries. Conclusions To our knowledge, this study is the first to combine full birth histories and mortality estimates from external reliable sources to model age patterns of under-5 mortality across time in SSA. We demonstrate that countries with a rapid pace of mortality reduction (ARR ≥ 3.2{\%}) across ages would be more likely to achieve the SDG mortality targets. However, the lower pace of neonatal mortality reduction would prevent most countries from achieving those targets: 2 countries would reach them by 2030, 13 between 2030 and 2050, and 13 after 2050.},

abstract = {Many people living in low and middle-income countries are not covered by civil registration and vital statistics systems. Consequently, a wide variety of other types of data including many household sample surveys are used to estimate health and population indicators. In this paper we combine data from sample surveys and demographic surveillance systems to produce small area estimates of child mortality through time. Small area estimates are necessary to understand geographical heterogeneity in health indicators when full-coverage vital statistics are not available. For this endeavor spatio-temporal smoothing is beneficial to alleviate problems of data sparsity. The use of conventional hierarchical models requires careful thought since the survey weights may need to be considered to alleviate bias due to non-random sampling and non-response. The application that motivated this work is estimation of child mortality rates in five-year time intervals in regions of Tanzania. Data come from Demographic and Health Surveys conducted over the period 1991-2010 and two demographic surveillance system sites. We derive a variance estimator of under five years child mortality that accounts for the complex survey weighting. For our application, the hierarchical models we consider include random effects for area, time and survey and we compare models using a variety of measures including the conditional predictive ordinate (CPO). The method we propose is implemented via the fast and accurate integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA).},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Detailed spatial understanding of levels and trends in under-5 mortality is needed to improve the targeting of interventions to the areas of highest need, and to understand the sources of variation in mortality. To improve this understanding, we analysed local-level information on child mortality across sub-Saharan Africa between 1980-2010. METHODS We used data from 82 Demographic and Health Surveys in 28 sub-Saharan African countries, including the location and timing of 3{\textperiodcentered}24 million childbirths and 393 685 deaths, to develop high-resolution spatial maps of under-5 mortality in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. These estimates were at a resolution of 0{\textperiodcentered}1 degree latitude by 0{\textperiodcentered}1 degree longitude (roughly 10 km × 10 km). We then analysed this spatial information to distinguish within-country versus between-country sources of variation in mortality, to examine the extent to which declines in mortality have been accompanied by convergence in the distribution of mortality, and to study localised drivers of mortality differences, including temperature, malaria burden, and conflict. FINDINGS In our sample of sub-Saharan African countries from the 1980s to the 2000s, within-country differences in under-5 mortality accounted for 74-78{\%} of overall variation in under-5 mortality across space and over time. Mortality differed significantly across only 8-15{\%} of country borders, supporting the role of local, rather than national, factors in driving mortality patterns. We found that by the end of the study period, 23{\%} of the eligible children in the study countries continue to live in mortality hotspots-areas where, if current trends continue, the Sustainable Developent Goals mortality targets will not be met. In multivariate analysis, within-country mortality levels at each pixel were significantly related to local temperature, malaria burden, and recent history of conflict. INTERPRETATION Our findings suggest that sub-national determinants explain a greater portion of under-5 mortality than do country-level characteristics. Sub-national measures of child mortality could provide a more accurate, and potentially more actionable, portrayal of where and why children are still dying than can national statistics.

The usefulness of vital statistics depends on their quality. In the second paper in this Series we propose a comprehensive and practical framework for assessment of the quality of vital statistics. With use of routine reports to the UN and cause-of-death data reported to WHO, we review the present situation and past trends of vital statistics in the world and note little improvement in worldwide availability of general vital statistics or cause-of-death statistics. Only a few developing countries have been able to improve their civil registration and vital statistics systems in the past 50 years. International efforts to improve comparability of vital statistics seem to be effective, and there is reasonable progress in collection and publication of data. However, worldwide efforts to improve data have been limited to sporadic and short-term measures. We conclude that countries and developmental partners have not recognised that civil registration systems are a priority.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Under-five mortality is declining in Ghana and many other countries. Very few studies have measured under-five mortality-and its social and environmental risk factors-at fine spatial resolutions, which is relevant for policy purposes. Our aim was to estimate under-five mortality and its social and environmental risk factors at the district level in Ghana. METHODS AND FINDINGS We used 10{\%} random samples of Ghana's 2000 and 2010 National Population and Housing Censuses. We applied indirect demographic methods and a Bayesian spatial model to the information on total number of children ever born and children surviving to estimate under-five mortality (probability of dying by 5 y of age, 5q0) for each of Ghana's 110 districts. We also used the census data to estimate the distributions of households or persons in each district in terms of fuel used for cooking, sanitation facility, drinking water source, and parental education. Median district 5q0 declined from 99 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2000 to 70 in 2010. The decline ranged from {\textless}5{\%} in some northern districts, where 5q0 had been higher in 2000, to {\textgreater}40{\%} in southern districts, where it had been lower in 2000, exacerbating existing inequalities. Primary education increased in men and women, and more households had access to improved water and sanitation and cleaner cooking fuels. Higher use of liquefied petroleum gas for cooking was associated with lower 5q0 in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS Under-five mortality has declined in all of Ghana's districts, but the cross-district inequality in mortality has increased. There is a need for additional data, including on healthcare, and additional environmental and socioeconomic measurements, to understand the reasons for the variations in mortality levels and trends.},

abstract = {Improved understanding of sub-national geographic variation and inequity in demographic and health indicators is increasingly recognized as central to meeting development goals. Data from DHS surveys are critical to monitoring progress in these indicators but are generally not used to support sub-national evaluation below the first-level administrative unit. This study explored the potential of geostatistical approaches for the production of interpolated surfaces from GPS cluster located survey data, and for the prediction of gridded surfaces at 5×5km resolution. The impact of DHS cluster displacement on these interpolated surfaces and the particular challenges of mapping in highly heterogeneous urban areas were also investigated. A flexible and robust geostatistical framework was proposed for generating and validating interpolated surfaces with georeferenced DHS survey data. The framework was tested by using four indicators from three different surveys. The accuracy of the interpolated surfaces varied between settings, and was driven by the spatial structure of each indicator and its relationship to available covariate data. The random displacement of DHS cluster geopositioning information reduced the precision of predicted maps, although the impact varied between settings and was generally modest. Over shorter distances, the greater degree of geographical heterogeneity that was associated with urban areas meant they were more sensitive to the impact of cluster displacement. High-resolution covariates and novel statistical approaches showed potential for improving mapping in these areas. This study demonstrated that, with appropriate modeling and validation, such data have broad utility for creating maps of a wide range of indicators that support improved geographically stratified decision-making.},

abstract = {Summary Background Estimation of the number and rate of deaths by age and sex is a key first stage for calculation of the burden of disease in order to constrain estimates of cause-specific mortality and to measure premature mortality in populations. We aimed to estimate life tables and annual numbers of deaths for 187 countries from 1970 to 2010. Methods We estimated trends in under-5 mortality rate (children aged 0–4 years) and probability of adult death (15–59 years) for each country with all available data. Death registration data were available for more than 100 countries and we corrected for undercount with improved death distribution methods. We applied refined methods to survey data on sibling survival that correct for survivor, zero-sibling, and recall bias. We separately estimated mortality from natural disasters and wars. We generated final estimates of under-5 mortality and adult mortality from the data with Gaussian process regression. We used these results as input parameters in a relational model life table system. We developed a model to extrapolate mortality to 110 years of age. All death rates and numbers have been estimated with 95{\%} uncertainty intervals (95{\%} UIs). Findings From 1970 to 2010, global male life expectancy at birth increased from 56{\textperiodcentered}4 years (95{\%} UI 55{\textperiodcentered}5–57{\textperiodcentered}2) to 67{\textperiodcentered}5 years (66{\textperiodcentered}9–68{\textperiodcentered}1) and global female life expectancy at birth increased from 61{\textperiodcentered}2 years (60{\textperiodcentered}2–62{\textperiodcentered}0) to 73{\textperiodcentered}3 years (72{\textperiodcentered}8–73{\textperiodcentered}8). Life expectancy at birth rose by 3–4 years every decade from 1970, apart from during the 1990s (increase in male life expectancy of 1{\textperiodcentered}4 years and in female life expectancy of 1{\textperiodcentered}6 years). Substantial reductions in mortality occurred in eastern and southern sub-Saharan Africa since 2004, coinciding with increased coverage of antiretroviral therapy and preventive measures against malaria. Sex-specific changes in life expectancy from 1970 to 2010 ranged from gains of 23–29 years in the Maldives and Bhutan to declines of 1–7 years in Belarus, Lesotho, Ukraine, and Zimbabwe. Globally, 52{\textperiodcentered}8 million (95{\%} UI 51{\textperiodcentered}6–54{\textperiodcentered}1 million) deaths occurred in 2010, which is about 13{\textperiodcentered}5{\%} more than occurred in 1990 (46{\textperiodcentered}5 million [45{\textperiodcentered}7–47{\textperiodcentered}4 million]), and 21{\textperiodcentered}9{\%} more than occurred in 1970 (43{\textperiodcentered}3 million [42{\textperiodcentered}2–44{\textperiodcentered}6 million]). Proportionally more deaths in 2010 occurred at age 70 years and older (42{\textperiodcentered}8{\%} in 2010 vs 33{\textperiodcentered}1{\%} in 1990), and 22{\textperiodcentered}9{\%} occurred at 80 years or older. Deaths in children younger than 5 years declined by almost 60{\%} since 1970 (16{\textperiodcentered}4 million [16{\textperiodcentered}1–16{\textperiodcentered}7 million] in 1970 vs 6{\textperiodcentered}8 million [6{\textperiodcentered}6–7{\textperiodcentered}1 million] in 2010), especially at ages 1–59 months (10{\textperiodcentered}8 million [10{\textperiodcentered}4–11{\textperiodcentered}1 million] in 1970 vs 4{\textperiodcentered}0 million [3{\textperiodcentered}8–4{\textperiodcentered}2 million] in 2010). In all regions, including those most affected by HIV/AIDS, we noted increases in mean ages at death. Interpretation Despite global and regional health crises, global life expectancy has increased continuously and substantially in the past 40 years. Yet substantial heterogeneity exists across age groups, among countries, and over different decades. 179 of 187 countries have had increases in life expectancy after the slowdown in progress in the 1990s. Efforts should be directed to reduce mortality in low-income and middle-income countries. Potential underestimation of achievement of the Millennium Development Goal 4 might result from limitations of demographic data on child mortality for the most recent time period. Improvement of civil registration system worldwide is crucial for better tracking of global mortality. Funding Bill {\&} Melinda Gates Foundation.},

abstract = {The growing demand for spatially detailed data to advance the Sustainable Development Goals agenda of 'leaving no one behind' has resulted in a shift in focus from aggregate national and province-based metrics to small areas and high-resolution grids in the health and development arena. Vaccination coverage is customarily measured through aggregate-level statistics, which mask fine-scale heterogeneities and 'coldspots' of low coverage. This paper develops a methodology for high-resolution mapping of vaccination coverage using areal data in settings where point-referenced survey data are inaccessible. The proposed methodology is a binomial spatial regression model with a logit link and a combination of covariate data and random effects modelling two levels of spatial autocorrelation in the linear predictor. The principal aspect of the model is the melding of the misaligned areal data and the prediction grid points using the regression component and each of the conditional autoregressive and the Gaussian spatial process random effects. The Bayesian model is fitted using the INLA-SPDE approach. We demonstrate the predictive ability of the model using simulated data sets. The results obtained indicate a good predictive performance by the model, with correlations of between 0.66 and 0.98 obtained at the grid level between true and predicted values. The methodology is applied to predicting the coverage of measles and diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccinations at 5x5 km in Afghanistan and Pakistan using subnational Demographic and Health Surveys data. The predicted maps are used to highlight vaccination coldspots and assess progress towards coverage targets to facilitate the implementation of more geographically precise interventions. The proposed methodology can be readily applied to wider disaggregation problems in related contexts, including mapping other health and development indicators.},

abstract = {Statistical inference is a widely-used, powerful tool for learning about natural processes in diverse fields. The statistical software platforms AD Model Builder (ADMB) and Template Model Builder (TMB) are particularly popular in the ecological literature, where they are typically used to perform frequentist inference of complex models. However, both lack capabilities for flexible and efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) integration. Recently, the no-U-turn sampler (NUTS) MCMC algorithm has gained popularity for Bayesian inference through the software Stan because it is efficient for high dimensional, complex hierarchical models. Here, we introduce the R packages adnuts and tmbstan, which provide NUTS sampling in parallel and interactive diagnostics with ShinyStan. The ADMB source code was modified to provide NUTS, while TMB models are linked directly into Stan. We describe the packages, provide case studies demonstrating their use, and contrast performance against Stan. For TMB models, we show how to test the accuracy of the Laplace approximation using NUTS. For complex models, the performance of ADMB and TMB was typically within +/- 50{\%} the speed of Stan. In one TMB case study we found inaccuracies in the Laplace approximation, potentially leading to biased inference. adnuts provides a new method for estimating hierarchical ADMB models which previously were infeasible. TMB users can fit the same model in both frequentist and Bayesian paradigms, including using NUTS to test the validity of the Laplace approximation of the marginal likelihood for arbitrary subsets of parameters. These software developments extend the available statistical methods of the ADMB and TMB user base with no additional effort by the user.},

abstract = {Understanding the patterns of HIV/AIDS epidemics is crucial to tracking and monitoring the progress of prevention and control efforts in countries. We provide a comprehensive assessment of the levels and trends of HIV/AIDS incidence, prevalence, mortality, and coverage of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for 1980-2017 and forecast these estimates to 2030 for 195 countries and territories. METHODS We determined a modelling strategy for each country on the basis of the availability and quality of data. For countries and territories with data from population-based seroprevalence surveys or antenatal care clinics, we estimated prevalence and incidence using an open-source version of the Estimation and Projection Package-a natural history model originally developed by the UNAIDS Reference Group on Estimates, Modelling, and Projections. For countries with cause-specific vital registration data, we corrected data for garbage coding (ie, deaths coded to an intermediate, immediate, or poorly defined cause) and HIV misclassification. We developed a process of cohort incidence bias adjustment to use information on survival and deaths recorded in vital registration to back-calculate HIV incidence. For countries without any representative data on HIV, we produced incidence estimates by pulling information from observed bias in the geographical region. We used a re-coded version of the Spectrum model (a cohort component model that uses rates of disease progression and HIV mortality on and off ART) to produce age-sex-specific incidence, prevalence, and mortality, and treatment coverage results for all countries, and forecast these measures to 2030 using Spectrum with inputs that were extended on the basis of past trends in treatment scale-up and new infections. FINDINGS Global HIV mortality peaked in 2006 with 1{\textperiodcentered}95 million deaths (95{\%} uncertainty interval 1{\textperiodcentered}87-2{\textperiodcentered}04) and has since decreased to 0{\textperiodcentered}95 million deaths (0{\textperiodcentered}91-1{\textperiodcentered}01) in 2017. New cases of HIV globally peaked in 1999 (3{\textperiodcentered}16 million, 2{\textperiodcentered}79-3{\textperiodcentered}67) and since then have gradually decreased to 1{\textperiodcentered}94 million (1{\textperiodcentered}63-2{\textperiodcentered}29) in 2017. These trends, along with ART scale-up, have globally resulted in increased prevalence, with 36{\textperiodcentered}8 million (34{\textperiodcentered}8-39{\textperiodcentered}2) people living with HIV in 2017. Prevalence of HIV was highest in southern sub-Saharan Africa in 2017, and countries in the region had ART coverage ranging from 65{\textperiodcentered}7{\%} in Lesotho to 85{\textperiodcentered}7{\%} in eSwatini. Our forecasts showed that 54 countries will meet the UNAIDS target of 81{\%} ART coverage by 2020 and 12 countries are on track to meet 90{\%} ART coverage by 2030. Forecasted results estimate that few countries will meet the UNAIDS 2020 and 2030 mortality and incidence targets. INTERPRETATION Despite progress in reducing HIV-related mortality over the past decade, slow decreases in incidence, combined with the current context of stagnated funding for related interventions, mean that many countries are not on track to reach the 2020 and 2030 global targets for reduction in incidence and mortality. With a growing population of people living with HIV, it will continue to be a major threat to public health for years to come.

abstract = {Assessments of age-specific mortality and life expectancy have been done by the UN Population Division, Department of Economics and Social Affairs (UNPOP), the United States Census Bureau, WHO, and as part of previous iterations of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD). Previous iterations of the GBD used population estimates from UNPOP, which were not derived in a way that was internally consistent with the estimates of the numbers of deaths in the GBD. The present iteration of the GBD, GBD 2017, improves on previous assessments and provides timely estimates of the mortality experience of populations globally. METHODS The GBD uses all available data to produce estimates of mortality rates between 1950 and 2017 for 23 age groups, both sexes, and 918 locations, including 195 countries and territories and subnational locations for 16 countries. Data used include vital registration systems, sample registration systems, household surveys (complete birth histories, summary birth histories, sibling histories), censuses (summary birth histories, household deaths), and Demographic Surveillance Sites. In total, this analysis used 8259 data sources. Estimates of the probability of death between birth and the age of 5 years and between ages 15 and 60 years are generated and then input into a model life table system to produce complete life tables for all locations and years. Fatal discontinuities and mortality due to HIV/AIDS are analysed separately and then incorporated into the estimation. We analyse the relationship between age-specific mortality and development status using the Socio-demographic Index, a composite measure based on fertility under the age of 25 years, education, and income. There are four main methodological improvements in GBD 2017 compared with GBD 2016: 622 additional data sources have been incorporated; new estimates of population, generated by the GBD study, are used; statistical methods used in different components of the analysis have been further standardised and improved; and the analysis has been extended backwards in time by two decades to start in 1950. FINDINGS Globally, 18{\textperiodcentered}7{\%} (95{\%} uncertainty interval 18{\textperiodcentered}4-19{\textperiodcentered}0) of deaths were registered in 1950 and that proportion has been steadily increasing since, with 58{\textperiodcentered}8{\%} (58{\textperiodcentered}2-59{\textperiodcentered}3) of all deaths being registered in 2015. At the global level, between 1950 and 2017, life expectancy increased from 48{\textperiodcentered}1 years (46{\textperiodcentered}5-49{\textperiodcentered}6) to 70{\textperiodcentered}5 years (70{\textperiodcentered}1-70{\textperiodcentered}8) for men and from 52{\textperiodcentered}9 years (51{\textperiodcentered}7-54{\textperiodcentered}0) to 75{\textperiodcentered}6 years (75{\textperiodcentered}3-75{\textperiodcentered}9) for women. Despite this overall progress, there remains substantial variation in life expectancy at birth in 2017, which ranges from 49{\textperiodcentered}1 years (46{\textperiodcentered}5-51{\textperiodcentered}7) for men in the Central African Republic to 87{\textperiodcentered}6 years (86{\textperiodcentered}9-88{\textperiodcentered}1) among women in Singapore. The greatest progress across age groups was for children younger than 5 years; under-5 mortality dropped from 216{\textperiodcentered}0 deaths (196{\textperiodcentered}3-238{\textperiodcentered}1) per 1000 livebirths in 1950 to 38{\textperiodcentered}9 deaths (35{\textperiodcentered}6-42{\textperiodcentered}83) per 1000 livebirths in 2017, with huge reductions across countries. Nevertheless, there were still 5{\textperiodcentered}4 million (5{\textperiodcentered}2-5{\textperiodcentered}6) deaths among children younger than 5 years in the world in 2017. Progress has been less pronounced and more variable for adults, especially for adult males, who had stagnant or increasing mortality rates in several countries. The gap between male and female life expectancy between 1950 and 2017, while relatively stable at the global level, shows distinctive patterns across super-regions and has consistently been the largest in central Europe, eastern Europe, and central Asia, and smallest in south Asia. Performance was also variable across countries and time in observed mortality rates compared with those expected on the basis of development. INTERPRETATION This analysis of age-sex-specific mortality shows that there are remarkably complex patterns in population mortality across countries. The findings of this study highlight global successes, such as the large decline in under-5 mortality, which reflects significant local, national, and global commitment and investment over several decades. However, they also bring attention to mortality patterns that are a cause for concern, particularly among adult men and, to a lesser extent, women, whose mortality rates have stagnated in many countries over the time period of this study, and in some cases are increasing.

abstract = {Improved understanding of geographic variation and inequity in health status, wealth, and access to resources within countries is central to meeting sustainable development goals. The Demographic Health Survey (DHS) Program's modeled surface contributes to the greater need of the development community for small area estimations of health and demographics. The DHS Program is making publicly available a standard set of spatially modeled surfaces for each population-based survey with a select list of indicators relevant for health, demographic, and development decision-making. The modeled surfaces are created with geo-coded cluster information for current and future population-based DHS surveys and a selection of earlier surveys. The maps are publicly available for download on The DHS Program Spatial Data Repository (http://spatialdata.dhsprogram.com/). This guidance document will provide users with a deeper understanding of The DHS Program modeled surfaces and their potential use in decision-making. The DHS Program has adopted the Model-Based Geostatistics (MBG) approach to creating the modeled surfaces. This is a method for creating statistically rigorous interpolated surfaces that generate new data values for unsampled areas from sampled data points. Such an expansive number of modeled surfaces for a diverse group of health and demographic indicators has never been offered in the past and, as such, the potential uses are still nascent. Many users will find new, innovative ways to use the modeled surfaces that are not discussed or fully analyzed in this document.},

abstract = {Of particular importance to the study of large-scale phenomena in physical geography is the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP). While often viewed as only a problem in human geography (particularly demographic studies), the MAUP is an issue for all quantitative studies in geography of spatial phenomena (Openshaw and Taylor, 1979). Increasingly, remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are being used to assess the distribution of phenomena from a large scale. These phenomena are modelled using areal units that can take any shape or size resulting in complications with statistical analysis related to both the scale and method used to create the areal units. In this paper, we define the modifiable areal unit problem, present examples of when it is a problem in physical geography studies, and review some potential solutions to the problem. Our aim is to increase awareness of this complicated issue and to promote further discussion and interest in this topic.},

abstract = {In this study, annual runoff is estimated by using a Bayesian geostatistical model for interpolating hydrological data of different spatial support. That is, streamflow observations from catchments (areal data), and precipitation and evaporation data (point data). The model contains one climatic spatial effect that is common for all years under study, and one year specific spatial effect. The climatic effect provides a framework for exploiting sparse datasets that include short records of runoff, and we obtain a model that can be used for spatial interpolation and for gaining knowledge about future annual runoff. The model's ability to predict annual runoff is investigated using 10 years of data from the Voss area in Western Norway and through a simulation study. On average we benefit from combining point and areal data compared to using only one of the data types, and the interaction between nested areal data and point data gives a geostatistical model that takes us beyond smoothing. Another finding is that climatic effects dominates over annual effects in Voss. This implies that systematic under- and overestimation of runoff often occur, but also that short-records of runoff from an otherwise ungauged catchment can lead to large improvements in the predictability of runoff.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND During the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) era, many countries in Africa achieved marked reductions in under-5 and neonatal mortality. Yet the pace of progress toward these goals substantially varied at the national level, demonstrating an essential need for tracking even more local trends in child mortality. With the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015, which established ambitious targets for improving child survival by 2030, optimal intervention planning and targeting will require understanding of trends and rates of progress at a higher spatial resolution. In this study, we aimed to generate high-resolution estimates of under-5 and neonatal all-cause mortality across 46 countries in Africa. METHODS We assembled 235 geographically resolved household survey and census data sources on child deaths to produce estimates of under-5 and neonatal mortality at a resolution of 5 × 5 km grid cells across 46 African countries for 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015. We used a Bayesian geostatistical analytical framework to generate these estimates, and implemented predictive validity tests. In addition to reporting 5 × 5 km estimates, we also aggregated results obtained from these estimates into three different levels—national, and subnational administrative levels 1 and 2—to provide the full range of geospatial resolution that local, national, and global decision makers might require. FINDINGS Amid improving child survival in Africa, there was substantial heterogeneity in absolute levels of under-5 and neonatal mortality in 2015, as well as the annualised rates of decline achieved from 2000 to 2015. Subnational areas in countries such as Botswana, Rwanda, and Ethiopia recorded some of the largest decreases in child mortality rates since 2000, positioning them well to achieve SDG targets by 2030 or earlier. Yet these places were the exception for Africa, since many areas, particularly in central and western Africa, must reduce under-5 mortality rates by at least 8{\textperiodcentered}8{\%} per year, between 2015 and 2030, to achieve the SDG 3.2 target for under-5 mortality by 2030. INTERPRETATION In the absence of unprecedented political commitment, financial support, and medical advances, the viability of SDG 3.2 achievement in Africa is precarious at best. By producing under-5 and neonatal mortality rates at multiple levels of geospatial resolution over time, this study provides key information for decision makers to target interventions at populations in the greatest need. In an era when precision public health increasingly has the potential to transform the design, implementation, and impact of health programmes, our 5 × 5 km estimates of child mortality in Africa provide a baseline against which local, national, and global stakeholders can map the pathways for ending preventable child deaths by 2030.

abstract = {High resolution, contemporary data on human population distributions are vital for measuring impacts of population growth, monitoring human-environment interactions and for planning and policy development. Many methods are used to disaggregate census data and predict population densities for finer scale, gridded population data sets. We present a new semi-automated dasymetric modeling approach that incorporates detailed census and ancillary data in a flexible, "Random Forest" estimation technique. We outline the combination of widely available, remotely-sensed and geospatial data that contribute to the modeled dasymetric weights and then use the Random Forest model to generate a gridded prediction of population density at {\~{}}100 m spatial resolution. This prediction layer is then used as the weighting surface to perform dasymetric redistribution of the census counts at a country level. As a case study we compare the new algorithm and its products for three countries (Vietnam, Cambodia, and Kenya) with other common gridded population data production methodologies. We discuss the advantages of the new method and increases over the accuracy and flexibility of those previous approaches. Finally, we outline how this algorithm will be extended to provide freely-available gridded population data sets for Africa, Asia and Latin America.},

abstract = {The under-five mortality rate (U5MR) is a critical and widely available population health indicator. Both the MDGs and SDGs define targets for improvement in the U5MR, and the SDGs require spatial disaggregation of indicators. We estimate trends in the U5MR for Admin-1 subnational areas using 122 DHS surveys in 35 countries in Africa and assess progress toward the MDG target reductions for each subnational region and each country as a whole. In each country, direct weighted estimates of the U5MR from each survey are calculated and combined into a single estimate for each Admin-1 region across five-year periods. Our method fully accounts for the sample design of each survey. The region-time-specific estimates are smoothed using a Bayesian, space-time model that produces more precise estimates (when compared to the direct estimates) at a one-year scale that are consistent with each other in both space and time. The resulting estimated distributions of the U5MR are summarized and used to assess subnational progress toward the MDG 4 target of two-thirds reduction in the U5MR during 1990–2015. Our space-time modeling approach is tractable and can be readily applied to a large collection of sample survey data. Subnational, regional spatial heterogeneity in the levels and trends in the U5MR vary considerably across Africa. There is no generalizable pattern between spatial heterogeneity and levels or trends in the U5MR. Subnational, small-area estimates of the U5MR: (i) identify subnational regions where interventions are still necessary and those where improvement is well under way; and (ii) countries where there is very little spatial variation and others where there are important differences between subregions in both levels and trends. More work is necessary to improve both the data sources and methods necessary to adequately measure subnational progress toward the SDG child survival targets.},

The integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) approach proposed by Rue, Martino, and Chopin (2009) is a computationally effective alternative to MCMC for Bayesian inference. INLA is designed for latent Gaussian models, a very wide and flexible class of models ranging from (generalized) linear mixed to spatial and spatio-temporal models. Combined with the stochastic partial differential equation approach (SPDE, Lindgren, Rue, and Lindstr{\"{o}}m 2011), one can accommodate all kinds of geographically referenced data, including areal and geostatistical ones, as well as spatial point process data. The implementation interface covers stationary spatial models, non-stationary spatial models, and also spatio-temporal models, and is applicable in epidemiology, ecology, environmental risk assessment, as well as general geostatistics.},

abstract = {Since 2000, many countries have achieved considerable success in improving child survival, but localized progress remains unclear. To inform efforts towards United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3.2—to end preventable child deaths by 2030—we need consistently estimated data at the subnational level regarding child mortality rates and trends. Here we quantified, for the period 2000–2017, the subnational variation in mortality rates and number of deaths of neonates, infants and children under 5 years of age within 99 low- and middle-income countries using a geostatistical survival model. We estimated that 32{\%} of children under 5 in these countries lived in districts that had attained rates of 25 or fewer child deaths per 1,000 live births by 2017, and that 58{\%} of child deaths between 2000 and 2017 in these countries could have been averted in the absence of geographical inequality. This study enables the identification of high-mortality clusters, patterns of progress and geographical inequalities to inform appropriate investments and implementations that will help to improve the health of all populations. A high-resolution, global atlas of mortality of children under five years of age between 2000 and 2017 highlights subnational geographical inequalities in the distribution, rates and absolute counts of child deaths by age.},

abstract = {Too often, I feel as though I live in two worlds. One is populated by scientists working on advanced tools, such as big data, sequencing, and data-based disease surveillance. The other is populated by public health professionals working on the demanding challenges of combating infectious diseases, empowering women and girls, and ensuring that more children survive and thrive. If we want to achieve the ambitions set out by the United Nations for global health and development by 2030, we need to bring these two worlds closer together through a new concept—precision public health. ![Figure][1]{\textless}/img{\textgreater} PHOTO: {\textcopyright}BILL {\&} MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION/RICCARDO GANGALE {\textgreater} “Precision public health is already happening{\ldots}” The idea of precision public health has its roots in the precision medicine revolution, particularly in cancer treatment. By harnessing more effective tools—from big data to predictive analytics—oncologists are making more informed therapy decisions, applying specific agents to subtypes of tumors in ways that minimize side effects and maximize optimal clinical outcomes. This approach is starting to transform the way physicians think about treating other diseases, enabling different strategies, for different patients, at different times. Can we take the principles of precision medicine a step further, from individuals to populations? Today, public health strategies involve epidemiologists examining geography, medical histories, biomarkers, and physical and demographic characteristics; and measuring exposures, behaviors, and susceptibility. General policies and programs are then developed. But a one-size-fits-all process does not always bring desired results. By more accurately detecting, identifying, and tracking unique traits in subpopulations, subgroups, or even communities, we can respond with greater precision. Precision public health is already happening in a limited way, with big impact. Worldwide, around 17 million women are living with HIV. If an infected individual gets pregnant, she can pass the virus to her baby. Half those babies will die before their second birthday. Antiretroviral therapy almost guarantees that mothers will not pass on the virus. However, it has not been possible to test every pregnant woman everywhere for HIV, and then treat those who test positive. Instead, testing and treatment are focused on the areas of sub-Saharan Africa where enhanced data collection and analysis have revealed that HIV among women is most prevalent. This more exact approach to a public health problem has cut HIV transmission to babies by almost half in 5 years. Although technological and scientific advances are changing the way some diseases and conditions are tracked and treated, there has been too little focus on how scientific tools used in high-resource areas can help people in low-resource areas. Take, for example, the lack of specificity around the 2.6 million neonatal deaths every year, most of which occur in the world's poorest countries. Much of what we know about them relies on “verbal autopsies” and model data. The Bill {\&} Melinda Gates Foundation is now working with partners on a program that takes tissue samples from the newborn to determine causes of death more definitively. The goal is to identify trends in a particular region, and then deliver specific interventions to help reduce infant mortality. Ultimately, I believe this approach could help save 1 million babies every year. Imagine what more could be achieved. More children will survive and thrive if we know more about the causes of malnutrition in different populations with different diets and cultural practices. More women will avoid cervical cancer, the leading cause of cancer deaths in low-resource countries, if we know more about different risks in different populations. Fewer people will contract malaria if we know more about how it spreads differently among populations, and how the parasite and mosquito become resistant to remedies. We have the tools to bring the right interventions, to the right people, in the right places to save lives. Now, we just need the will.},

abstract = {Spatial data relating to non-overlapping areal units are prevalent in fields such as economics, environmental science, epidemiology and social science, and a large suite of modeling tools have been developed for analysing these data. Many utilize conditional autoregressive (CAR) priors to capture the spatial autocorrelation inherent in these data, and software packages such as CARBayes and R-INLA have been developed to make these models easily accessible to others. Such spatial data are typically available for multiple time periods, and the development of methodology for capturing temporally changing spatial dynamics is the focus of much current research. A sizeable proportion of this literature has focused on extending CAR priors to the spatio-temporal domain, and this article presents the R package CARBayesST, which is the first dedicated software package for spatio-temporal areal unit modeling with conditional autoregressive priors. The software package allows to fit a range of models focused on different aspects of spacetime modeling, including estimation of overall space and time trends, and the identification of clusters of areal units that exhibit elevated values. This paper outlines the class of models that the software package implement, before applying them to simulated and two real examples from the fields of epidemiology and housing market analysis.},

abstract = {Importance Examining life expectancy by county allows for tracking geographic disparities over time and assessing factors related to these disparities. This information is potentially useful for policy makers, clinicians, and researchers seeking to reduce disparities and increase longevity. Objective To estimate annual life tables by county from 1980 to 2014; describe trends in geographic inequalities in life expectancy and age-specific risk of death; and assess the proportion of variation in life expectancy explained by variation in socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and metabolic risk factors, and health care factors. Design, Setting, and Participants Annual county-level life tables were constructed using small area estimation methods from deidentified death records from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), and population counts from the US Census Bureau, NCHS, and the Human Mortality Database. Measures of geographic inequality in life expectancy and age-specific mortality risk were calculated. Principal component analysis and ordinary least squares regression were used to examine the county-level association between life expectancy and socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and metabolic risk factors, and health care factors. Exposures County of residence. Main Outcomes and Measures Life expectancy at birth and age-specific mortality risk. Results Counties were combined as needed to create stable units of analysis over the period 1980 to 2014, reducing the number of areas analyzed from 3142 to 3110. In 2014, life expectancy at birth for both sexes combined was 79.1 (95{\%} uncertainty interval [UI], 79.0-79.1) years overall, but differed by 20.1 (95{\%} UI, 19.1-21.3) years between the counties with the lowest and highest life expectancy. Absolute geographic inequality in life expectancy increased between 1980 and 2014. Over the same period, absolute geographic inequality in the risk of death decreased among children and adolescents, but increased among older adults. Socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and metabolic risk factors, and health care factors explained 60{\%}, 74{\%}, and 27{\%} of county-level variation in life expectancy, respectively. Combined, these factors explained 74{\%} of this variation. Most of the association between socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors and life expectancy was mediated through behavioral and metabolic risk factors. Conclusions and Relevance Geographic disparities in life expectancy among US counties are large and increasing. Much of the variation in life expectancy among counties can be explained by a combination of socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and metabolic risk factors, and health care factors. Policy action targeting socioeconomic factors and behavioral and metabolic risk factors may help reverse the trend of increasing disparities in life expectancy in the United States.},
