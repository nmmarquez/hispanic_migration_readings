# Notes from Garip's On the Move  

## Introduction  
- The focus here is on Mexico-US Migration flows between 1965 and 2010  
- An analysis relying heavily on MMP and qualitative interviews from MMP connections  
- Garip argues that the majority of texts on this subject revolve around  
  1. Income maximization (individual model that is more of an optimization problem)  
  2. Risk diversification (families as the decision making unit)  
  3. Social ties and accumulation (social ties)  
- Garip wants to invertigate the diversity of those indviduals who cross the border  
- **Thesis 1: There is variation in the motivation driving individuals to migrate**  
- **Thesis 2: Individual interests are shaped by cultural context in both sending and recieving locations**  
- **Thesis 3: Different context my rely more heavily on different theoretical conceptualizations of migration**
