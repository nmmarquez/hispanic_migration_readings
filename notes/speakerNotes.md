# Fertility and Migration  
 - Where is the intersection between fertility and migration  
 - Higher rates of fertility for migrants  
   - nativist fears  
   - population stability maintained  
 - assimilation of fertility, whats it about?  
 - What is teh comparison group here?  
 - But seriously what the fuck does assimilation mean here?  
 - **Does this apply to an internal migration context as well?**  
 - Check out Trajectories et Origines Survey in France  
 - **How do we deal with wildly different sample sizes in demographic comparisons?**  
 - Remember the difference between a child birth and number of children that mortality rates can alter  
 - Emphasis on selection vs adaptation of migrants on fertility patterns
