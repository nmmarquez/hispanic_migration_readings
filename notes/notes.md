# Notes from Mexican Migration Readings  

For each reading create a cover note and assess the gaps in the writing and how you could analyze them 

## Week 1: Historical Migration (Massey and Durand 2010)
### New World Orders  
 - Historically there has been a lot of immigration from the Mexico to US  
 - This is diversifying to new sources, central Am, and new destinations, Europe, Canada, Mexcio  
 - Trip the fuck out on Latin America going from a largely reciever location, for spanish and such, to senders, brown town  
 - Actually large scale migration to LA didnt occur until after independence  
 - Mexico in particular was in the middle of the pack for receiving spaniards en masse  
 - Other groups came too tho, Asian, Middle East, African  
 - LA needed migration to take advantage of labor markets, at least that was the colonial narrative lol  
 - Evrything changed after the germany nation attacked, again, we now see people leaving LA  
 - In the early days of LA migration to US it was all Mexicans and Peurto Ricans
 - Interestingly the authors attribute some portion of this to rising fertility, what up with that Raftery???    
 - Note that ricans had legal status even back then  
 - Qeue the US using LA for geopolitical aims installing right wing dictators where necessary  
 - Unfortunately the US did not also invest financially leading to a lot of economic ruin and then migration incentives set in  
 - Upward trend of latin american economies in th 90's, in part due to demand in China  
 - Still difficult to tell exact number of immigrant numbers but authors divide into hi and medium senders  
 - Authors divide migration drivers into 4 components economic, social, temporal, spatial  
 - Temporal refers to the focus of the migration event the leaving, the going, or the destination   
 - Deleve into three types of migration in Latin America  
 - Intraregional Migration  
   - Happening within LA countries  
   - in the 2nd half of the 20th century most countries had closed borders, exceptions being  
   - By in large liberalization of markets led to increase in migration for agricultural work  
   - Dont forget about Indigenous migration across borders (see Jorge Durand Mas Alla de La Linea)  
   - another portion do city to city migration or divided by skilled and unskilled sectors that rarely overlap  
   - Venezuela and Mexico have been disprportiantely recievers of skilled workers from 1950-80  
   - Movements to cities tend to be less seasonal and create labor and cultural niches  
   - Note that most South American and Central American countries have open border agreements
     - There are moments of dictator-like rule that restrict emigration and immigration however  
   - Notable exceptions are in Puerto Rico, Mexico, and Costa Rica  
 - South-North Migration  
   - Heavily US and largely Mexicans going to US, some PR, El Salv, Cuba, and DR as well  
   - Interesting thing is the growth of LA pop in US not just from migration but fertility  
   - Note their take on the youngness of the Hispanic group saying Mexicans are the youngest  
   - They compare age, education levels, sex
   - Remitences are mad important to migration  
   - As a function of total population, El Salv and PR have the biggest migrant and remitence numbers  
 - Trans-Oceanic Migration  
   - Largely Ecuador, Columbia and the DR going to Spain, Italy, Portugal, and Japan  
   - In Europe dual nationality is a big factor for moving between locations  
 - New Migration Patterns taht are important to consider  
 - Relay Migration  
   - Migration of labor sectors that can be viewed as hierarchical (Richer countries pulling labor sources from poorer countries)  
 - Transgenerational Migration  
   - Return migration generationally deferred  
   - In part caused by manipulation of identities and heritage  
   - What constitues who holds heritage in a place is really triky and often racially bounded  
   - Who really is Spanish or Japanese and living in LA?  
 - Conclusions  
   - LA emigration is really new outside of Mexicans in the US  
   - How this plays out over the years is yet to be seen  
   - Who migrates interms of SES, location-destination, age and gender need to all be examined  

### Mexican-American History an Assessment (Corwin 1973) 
 - This is an insight into the first perspectives of [La Raza in the US](https://www.texasarchive.org/library/index.php?title=North_From_Mexico_-_Exploration_%2B_Heritage)  
 - What is the history of those Mexicans who are in the South-West, if it is linked to Historical MX populations is questioned in this article  
 - Actually the whole claim of La Raza seems to be challenged by this homie  
 - How linked current injustices are to historical disputes of territory in the south-west is debated  
 - Author argues that a linked history between historical presence of MXs in the SW is missing  
 - There has been a high demand but authours have been to keen to link current injustices to historical happenings  
 - What is the heritage of the MX population in the SW but also who migrate?  
 - Writers are supposedly quick to label the aztec heritage but is that real? Does it matter?  
 - This article so far sounds like a conflict between Mexican and US Racialization processes  
 - The importance of the braceros program(1942-1964) as a bi-national agreememnt is highlighted in its relation to migration  
 - This is especially important to the creation of the H2A visa for agricultural workers  
 - Who represents terms like greasers, gringos, gabachos, chicanos, meskins, anglos, pochos, rinches, and la migra  
 - This homie really has it out for the politically socialist biased of Caery McWilliams  
 - this article is largely about what will be the foundations of Mexican-American history, who has ownership over that is a powerful question  
 - The end of this describes the differnces between Mexican-American estblishment school of thought and La raza chicano school of thought  

### Mexican Emigration History 1900-1970: Literature and Research (Corwin 1973)  
 - Back to the Mcwilliams hate, but he does say no one is doing MX-AM history outside of him  
 - I mean people are doing ethnic studies but they are biased and caught up on "opression" happening "now" or whatever  
 - Like what happened during the great depression  
 - Some lines of research that havent been done yet  
 - What has been the US history of law concerning Migration from Mexico to the US  
 - Not enough about the US Border Patrol  
 - Not enough research on political refugees coming from Mexico  
 - Mexican Repatriation  

### A New Era of Mexican Migration to the United States(Massey Durand 1999)  
 - Golbal changes in the economic markets sparked migration but within developing countries, rural to urban, and south-north migration  
 - Neoliberal policies within NAFTA benifited some areas while hurting others in Mexico spurring some incentive for migration  
 - They argues that there is a connection between states that had high migration and remittances and quelling rebeliion in economic trying times  
 - They argue that the relationship between econmic crisis and migration was negative however was also used to spark nativist immigrant policies  
 - Recall the role of Ronald Reagan in moving the discussion of immigration as one of national security against drugs and terrorism  
 - Getting people to buy into IRCA required making appeasments to the left, right, civil rights workers, and employers who needed cheap labor  
 - Argue that the main effect of IRCA was ching seasonal patterns to permanent ones  
 - Authors make argument here that IRCA depressed wages not only for immigrant population but also coethnics  
 - Authurs use CPS data to track new incomimg migrants by state  
 - Pete Wilson, the Govenor of CA, wins election on back of Immigrant fear mongering that spreads to other states  
 - Further laws were passed restricting welfare for legal and undocumented immigrants  

### The Rise of New Immigrant Gateways (Singer 2004)  
 - Division of regions into six major types of gateways, havent seen this perspective before  
 - Uses deccenial census from 1900 to 2010 to describe changes in the immigrant population  
 - This paper largely is talking about the composition of immigrants so Im going to highlight changes here  
   - Immigrant population was largely european early on now very hispanic  
   - Immigrant population is at an absolute high, 31.1 million, and at a local relative high, 11%  
   - The U.S. foreign-born population grew 57.4 percent in the 1990s; by 2000 nearly one-third of U.S. immigrants resided outside established settlement states  
   - Historical settlement patterns along with recent influxes of immi- grants have produced six major types of U.S. immigrant gateways  
   - The construction of these gateways is largely embedded in hsitorical knowledge however I thinkk we should think about new ways to construt them  
   - emerging immigrant gate- ways experienced rapid growth of both the foreign and native born between 1980 and 2000, while the more established gateways experienced slower percentage growth of both  
   - **At this sclae it appears that growth of native and foreign populations happen in tandem**  
   - The spatial aggregation makes me wonder at what point does this phenomenon break
   - Immigrants and natives are more often than not living in different homes so at what sptaial aggregation level do we see them moving to the same place  
   - Theoretically what does mean for their movement, are they occupying different economic spaces as well as physical space? Socio-cultural space?  
   - By 2000 more immigrants in metropolitan areas lived in suburbs than cities, and growth rates there exceeded those in the cities  
   - What does this shift indicate? Are immigrants changing, being displaced, or are the draw factors shifting? something else???  
   - Recent arrivals to the newest immigrant gateways tend to come from Asia or Mexico, are poorer than the native-born population, and have low English proficiency and lower rates of US citezensip  
   - covariates of interest here include language acquisition, citezenship, and income level  
 - the immigration context varies tremendously between metropolitan areas.
 - it behooves every local government, community based organization, and advocate to understand the characteristics of its local immigrant community  
 - the need to Create Linkages to Mainstream Institutions  
 - encourage civic engagement among these populations  

### The Emergence of New Hispanic Settlement Patterns in Appalachia (Barcus 2007)  
 - Already we have a novel geographic locationn of concern  
 - What makes apalchian immigrants from LA different from other contexts  
 - The other really wants to know the change in the socio-economic context of where immigrants have occupied  
 - U.S. Hispanic settlement geographies are tied to global, national, and regional processes with history and immigration policy playing significant roles in determining both the composition and size of migrant flows and the increasingly dispersed settlement patterns  
 - Author talks about diversity of locations increasing and this is quantified in The Changing Geography of Mexican Immigration (mass & dur)
 - This could use a series update and in depth review though  
 - The author states that Massey 2000 mentioned about is heavily defined by US policy  
 - ethnic restructuring may occur alongside economic changes within a region, & is dependent upon & influenced by international & domestic migration  
 - new settlement patterns is response to response to changes in economic conditions, shifting government policies, new informationon alternative locations, employment opportunities, housing and cultural effects.  
 - This author chooses to use county level data for dispersion measures in Apalachia  
 - Demographics, age and sex, income level, as well as educational attainment are given for population oof interest  
 - Spatial grouping by origin country is also conducted  
 - The author does coanalysis of native and foreign born hispanics indicating a comoving pattern as both are assessed at adulthood  
 - In order to describe the diversity of growth in Appalachi a cluster analysis is used for hi and lo growth locations  
 - check out this [table](https://i.imgur.com/JajUpiU.png) of the differences that were selected on  
 - author argues on diversity of region but is this diversity different than other areas and what are the implications  
 - findings support Newbold’s (1999) proposition that there are multiple stages to the settlement process of immigrants & successive generations  
 - not so sure about this need to dig in more to figure out  

### The Geography of Undocumented Mexican Migration (Massey, Rugh, Penn 2009)  
 - Here we have a new data source that was brought into teh mix Mexico’s Matricula Consular files  
 - I know that this data set has some issues but at some point in the near future I need to write up a description on commonon migration data
    - Write how the data is collected and what its intended purpose is  
    - How can the data be used for migration studies and what are the biases  
    - How have others used these data sources and tested the limitations  
 - Another dataset to look out for is Encuesta Nacional de la Dinámica Demografica  
 - The paper harps on how traditional data sources dont distguih on legal status or source location in MX  
 - The data is freely available to analyze [online](http://www.ime.gob.mx/estados.htm)  
 - Represents registrations of all MX citezens living in US who came forward in 2006 to one of the 53 consulates  
 - probably way biased for catchment areas and urban locations  
 - Massey contends that this is largely an undocumented population that thye are dealing with  
 - cannot be assumed to be random subset of all undocumented Mexican migrants, probably represent the more well-established, firmly settled portion  
 - 17 percent said that they had been here for less than two years  
 - Paper builds the foundation for regional differnces in sendimg from MX that is gone into in more depth in other papers  
 - regional differences are described for destination locations and drivers of this  
 - there is no map location of these consulate locations I need to see one 
 - How this changes over time is not well addressed but may be beyond the scope of the data  
 - need more of a conversation on socio-political differences across source regions  

### Mexican Immigrant Replenishment and the Continuing Signifigance of Ethnicity and Race  
 - Identity of Hispanic individuals as other grou is in part reinforced by continuing migration from Mexico  
 - Assimilation is also impacted by this as migrants continue to shape perception  
 - Previous groups became white through a decline in immigrant groups and generations of assimilation  
 - Check out phenotype studies by Telles and Murguia  
 - Check out the rainbow underclass of second generation Mexicans in Portes Rumbaut 2001  
 - Of Mexican-Americans education and age strongly correlates with generational positioning  
 - Third generation hispanics and onward still lag behind whites, why is that? Do they stop identifying as Hispanic?  
 - By all measures the author argues that Mexican Americans meet the usual criteria of assimialtion  
 - Yet these groups are still seen as others and the traits they are associated with are not different than recent immigrants  
 - This othering is often attributed in inderect ways when comments about immigrants are made  
 - Individuals mileage varies on the degree to which attributions happen but it also happens in a group context  
 - Racialization is partly phenotypic and partly language barriers  

### Natural Increase: A New Source of Population Growth in Emerging Hispanic Destinations in the United States (Johnson and Lichter 2008)  
 - Hispanic population is diffusing maybe in part due to greater mobility afforded by IRCA  
 - Rural populations in teh United States are on the decline  
 - Rural populations are being rapidly altered by the Hispanic population  
 - **Check out the birth/death dataset at National Center for Health Statistics**  
 - **Also check out birth/death/migration data from Federal state cooperative program for population estaimtes**  
 - Hispanics are concentrated in metro areas: 92.7 percent  
 - Despite this, immigrants represent a signficant share of the rural population growth  
 - Between 2000 and 2005 221 ounties experienced population growth only because hispanic growth offset other decines  
 - Birth to death ratio of hispanics is mad high compared to other groups  
 - See the typologies opf growth on page 337 also used in Kandel and Cromartie 2004  
 - Hispanic population has shifted to growth from immigration to growth from natural increase  
 - This is especially true in urban areas but also true for rural areas with high immigrant growth  
 
### Hispanic Assimilation and Fertility in New Destinations (Lichter, Johnson, Turner, Churilla 2012)  
 - fertility is a common measure of assimilation used inn demograpgic studies  
 - Hispanic fertility is higher than non-Hispanc white fertility  
 - Immigrant groups have the highest levevl of fertility differences  
 - This declined in subsequent generations of Hispanic populations but they are still relatively high  
 - Can this difference be explained by socio-demographic characteristics alone?   
 - Using the classic residual method for assessing differnces in fertility  
 - How does the ethnic compossition of the recieving community alter individuals fertiility pattern?  
 - Myabe just more generally how does the receiving community differ in fertility patterns? (summy variables for CPUMA)  
 - Not addressed is how do the sending communities influence fertility  
 - Data used come from ACS files pooled 2005-2009 microdata, females aged 15-50  
 - Hispanics in new destination have higher TFR than classic destinations  
 - Immigrant hispanics have exceptionally high fertility rate  
 - __We need a better demo of how age isnt the driving factor here__  
 - There are a lot of implications here that high fertility is Hispanic Culture and Im not sure that this is the case  
 - I need to go over regression results in more detail for a better interpretation  

### Diverging Demography: Hispanic and Non-Hispanic Contributions to US Population Redistribution and Diversity (Johnson & Lichter 2016)  
 - Hispanics represent a small portion of the population in the US but account for a significnt amount of the growth  
 - Lots of shidfting from Urban core to more rural peripheries  
 - We need decompositions of what is contributing to the growing diversity here, is it high white deaths, high non-white births or immigration  
 - I keep seeing refernces to the rapid diffusion of Hispanic populations to rural locations but no quantification of it  
 - How does fertility correspond to intra-national migration?  
 - See this article for classifications on counties in realtion to their growth of Hispanic Population  
 - Very few counties lost population overall as well as lost hispanic populations  
 - Hispanic increases in many location s largely driven by natural gain, more births than deaths  
 - This is both due to higher fertility and lower death rate  
 - In emerging and new destinations, migration is the key factor to growth  
 - We are getting a lot of lumpng together of the hispanic native and foreign born population here and need to dig inti this  

### Migration Selection, Protection, and Acculturation in Health: A Binational Perspective on Older Adults (Riosmena et al 2013)  
 - Dive into the Hispanic Health Paradox (HHP) on why Hispanics have better health utcomes than predicted by their SES  
 - Most often expressed by low mortality but also some evidence of low morbidity   
 - Possible Explanations for the HHP are as follows  
   - Data artifacts: there is some bias in the data that doesnt let us see the more unhealthy populations  
   - Return migration selection (salmon bias): the unhealthy population returns when they are unwell  
   - Emigration selection factors: only the healthy can migrate  
   - Socio-cultural protections: support networks are strong in the US for Mexican communities  
   - Differences in Epidemiological Regimes: Exposures are different across the populations  
   - Negative Acculturation: There are differences and they tend to minimize over time when Hispanics acculturate to US lifestyles  
 - New data sourves being used here on health outcomes, one form the United States and anothe from Mexico  
 - **National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) in the United States and the Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS) in Mexico**  
 - Findings show that strong HHP only exists for migrants who remained in the US and only for hpertension  
 - US born hispanics had higher rates of all negative outcomes measured  
 - How does this comapre with life expectancy?  
 - Return attrition is not the entire explanation  
 - no evidence for socio-cultural factors  
 - Remember that this study is all about morbidity  
 - Effect are in the opposite direction for US born Hispanics  

### Aging Populations, Mortality, and Life Expectancy (Crimmins 2019)  
I feel like a few paragrphs sum up everything I need from this paper so imma paste them here 
  
Among Hispanics, favorable mortality has been reported for foreign-born Hispanics compared to their US-born counterparts (Hummer & Hayward 2015). This pattern is replicated in other racial/ethnic groups: Foreign-born groups have lower all-cause and cause-specific mortality rates than do US-born groups (Hummer&Gutin 2018). This is not surprising given an immigrant population that is selected by health at the time of migration, which tends to be concentrated in the early adult years. Among foreign-born Hispanics, foreign-born Cubans have relatively high life expectancy; foreign-born Mexicans have life expectancy similar to the total Hispanic population; and Puerto Ricans, who are of course US citizens, have lower life expectancy. US-born Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites do not have appreciable differences in life expectancy (Hummer & Hayward 2015). A significant part of the Hispanic advantage in life expectancy comes from low levels, and cohort patterns, of smoking, especially for women (Fenelon 2013b, Singh & Hiatt 2006).  
Hispanic men and women have lower mortality from both heart disease and cancer than whites and African Americans (Arias et al. 2015). In 2013, lower cancer mortality accounted for 0.7 years ofthe advantage Hispanics had in life expectancy relative to non-Hispanic whites and 1.4 years of the advantage they had relative to non-Hispanic African Americans. Similarly, lower mortality from heart disease contributed 0.4–0.6 years of the advantage that Hispanics had in life expectancy relative to non-Hispanic whites, and 1.4–1.7 years of the advantage that they had relative to non-Hispanic blacks (Arias et al. 2015). There are SES differentials in mortality among Hispanics, but they are smaller than those among non-Hispanic whites (Lariscy et al. 2015). Hispanics of the lowest SES are most respon- sible for the Hispanic paradox by having significantly better-than-expected life expectancy given their SES (Turra & Goldman 2007). While the Hispanic paradox has been clearly documented, further research on its causes is needed to understand the relative health of this large subgroup of Americans.

### Mortality Among Elderly Hispanics in the United States: Past Evidence and New Results (Elo et al 2004)  
 - Mortality differentials are difficult to keep tabs on especially with the relative newness of the Hispanic heritage  
 - **NUMIDENT FILES FOR SSA USED FOR MORTALITY RECORDS**  
 - Historically there has been several problems with reporting on mortality of Hispanics  
   - There are problems with who gets reported as hispanic  
   - Age misreporting tends to be an issue as well although the directionality of this is unclear  
   - Undercounts from the denominantor tends to be a greater issue for Hispanic immigrants  
 - **Check out the mortality estimates from the CPS**  
 - Linkage of selected CPS samples to the National Death Index (NDI) and the linkage of selected National Health Interview Surveys to the NDI
