# Demography  

# Hispanic Migration  

## Assimilation  
 - Classical: Latino mobility into neighborhoods that contain a greater proportion of Anglos should increase across generations, with enhanced human and financial capital, and with advanced English-language proficiency  
 - Segmented: in which different groups experience either traditional assimilation and upward mobility, downward mobility by unsuccessfully competing in the mainstream economy, or upward mobility by living and working in ethnically homogeneous immigrant communities (Jensen and Chitose 1996:83)  

## How do local contexts for immigrant perceptions play out  
 - This is going to be essential for quantifying the process you big dummy  
 - Jimenez and Rumbaut both talk about process of change in views of Hispanics and immigrants but talk aabout the national level  
 - How do we get at the local level and how do these differences manifest
